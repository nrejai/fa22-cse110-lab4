1. The loop goes through 3 iterations since the length of the array prices is 3, so at line 12 i=3 and i has a function scope so 3 is printed in the console.
2. After all 3 iterations of the loop, at line 13 the variable discountedPrice = 150 since 300*0.5=150, and discountedPrice has a function scope so 150 is printed in the console.
3. After all 3 iterations of the loop, at line 14 since the variable discountedPrice = 150, so finalPrice = (150*100)/100 = 150 and finalPrice has a function scope so 150 is printed in the console.
